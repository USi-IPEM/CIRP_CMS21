    abstract = "{Not all of the many approaches to quality control are equally effective. Nonconformities in laboratory testing are caused basically by excessive process variation and mistakes. Statistical quality control can effectively control process variation, but it cannot detect or prevent most mistakes. Because mistakes or blunders are frequently the dominant source of nonconformities, we conclude that statistical quality control by itself is not effective. I explore the 100\\% inspection methods essential for controlling mistakes. Unlike the inspection techniques that Deming described as ineffective, the new “source” inspection methods can detect mistakes and enable corrections before nonconformities are generated, achieving the highest degree of quality at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. Key relationships between task complexity and nonconformity rates are also described, along with cultural changes that are essential for implementing the best quality-control practices.}",

abstract="X-rays have a large range of medical applications and play an important role in imaging diagnostics. However, the ionized radiation that the patient is exposed to during its application is harmful. In order to keep the radiation exposure as low as possible and at the same time improve image quality, the development of X-ray tubes is being pushed to physical limits. These increased requirements create new challenges not only for product development, but also for the production of X-ray tubes. In addition to the chemical composition of the raw material, the manufacturing processes play a significant role in the quality and service life of the products. In order to obtain updated cause and effect relations and knowledge about the product from the quantity of influencing factors, a cross-process analysis of the manufacturing data is necessary. While classical statistical methods reach their limits in this task, machine learning (ML) algorithms seem promising in the analysis of high-dimensional data. However, according to today's state of the art, such analyses are accompanied by a considerable amount of pre-processing and data cleansing. This paper presents an approach with which the cross-process analysis of product quality can be realized in an efficient manner by creating a standardized procedure. The validation of the approach is based on a prototypical implementation for two product lines.",

abstract="In order to meet the growing demand for high-quality individualized products by end users, manufacturing companies need to establish new production technologies such as additive manufacturing. However, the industrial and automated application of these manufacturing technologies is currently impaired by low process stability and fluctuating product quality. This paper presents a novel approach for predicting product quality in Fused Deposition Modeling, based on process parameters, inline measurement data and a suitable machine learning algorithm. This should provide the basis for implementing process control and ensuring consistently high product quality.",
