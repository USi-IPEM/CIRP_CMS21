    abstract = "{Not all of the many approaches to quality control are equally effective. Nonconformities in laboratory testing are caused basically by excessive process variation and mistakes. Statistical quality control can effectively control process variation, but it cannot detect or prevent most mistakes. Because mistakes or blunders are frequently the dominant source of nonconformities, we conclude that statistical quality control by itself is not effective. I explore the 100\\% inspection methods essential for controlling mistakes. Unlike the inspection techniques that Deming described as ineffective, the new “source” inspection methods can detect mistakes and enable corrections before nonconformities are generated, achieving the highest degree of quality at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. Key relationships between task complexity and nonconformity rates are also described, along with cultural changes that are essential for implementing the best quality-control practices.}",

abstract="In order to meet the growing demand for high-quality individualized products by end users, manufacturing companies need to establish new production technologies such as additive manufacturing. However, the industrial and automated application of these manufacturing technologies is currently impaired by low process stability and fluctuating product quality. This paper presents a novel approach for predicting product quality in Fused Deposition Modeling, based on process parameters, inline measurement data and a suitable machine learning algorithm. This should provide the basis for implementing process control and ensuring consistently high product quality.",

abstract = { In today’s highly competitive global market, winning requires near-perfect quality. Although most mature organizations operate their processes at very low defects per million opportunities, customers expect completely defect-free products. Therefore, the prompt detection of rare quality events has become an issue of paramount importance and an opportunity for manufacturing companies to move quality standards forward. This article presents the learning process and pattern recognition strategy for a knowledge-based intelligent supervisory system, in which the main goal is the detection of rare quality events. Defect detection is formulated as a binary classification problem. The l1-regularized logistic regression is used as the learning algorithm for the classification task and to select the features that contain the most relevant information about the quality of the process. The proposed strategy is supported by the novelty of a hybrid feature elimination algorithm and optimal classification threshold search algorithm. According to experimental results, 100\% of defects can be detected effectively. }
