%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Procedia CIRP}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{Author name}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.
\jid{trpro}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
%\jnltitlelogo{Transportation Research}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.
%% For more details see the existing template files elsarticle-template-harv.tex and elsarticle-template-num.tex.

%% Elsevier CRC generally uses a numbered reference style
%% For this, the conventions of elsarticle-template-num.tex should be followed (included below)

\begin{abstract}
%% Text of abstract
Quality assurance (QA) is an important task in manufacturing to assess whether products 
meet their specifications. However, QA might be expensive, time-consuming, incomplete, or delayed.
This paper presents a solution for predictive analytics in QA based on machine sensor values during
production while employing machine-learning models based on logistic regression in a controlled environment. 
Furthermore, we present lessons learned while implementing this model, which helps to reduce complexity in
further industrial applications. The paper’s outcome proves that the developed model was able to predict
product quality, as well as to identify the correlation between machine-status and faulty product occurrence.

\section{Introduction} % 1 Page (incl authors, abstract)

\AP{\begin{itemize}
       \item	Products’ quality must always be guaranteed.
       \item	In certain cases (especially in series assembly production) there is a delay between quality inspection
              and end of the production process high potential for producing scrap 
       \item	By doing quality inspection based on samples, there is still a risk of sending NOK parts to customers
       \item	The cost of quality checks might be expensive
       \item	Quality assurance is normally done at the end of production (for assembly processes)   
       \item	Early prediction of the production’s quality  would help to decrease the amount of scrap  and the risk of sending NOK parts to customers
       \item	Variable predictions by using machine learning models is currently widely used in diverse fields due to its accurate predictions with the data collected from the machines, 
              prediction models can be implemented for specific predicted values

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Recording the data}


\subsection{Classifier optimization and testing}
We work with a total of 132 measurements. Each containing arm and belt data
logs of individual cell runs. 20 samples are set aside at random for testing 
purposes, leaving 112 training samples. The random number generator seed is
set to one in order to ensure the train and test set splits are identical 
for all experiments.

We compare a total of three different classifier architectures on the data.
A Support Vector Machine (SVM), a multilinear perceptron and a Random Forest
structure. All three methods are trained using standard hyperparameters.

                using the industry demo data test set.}
       \label{tab:class_comp}
\end{table}
Results are shown in table~\ref{tab:class_comp}. For 55 of the total 132 samples
quality measurements indicate a problem. This sets the 
baseline over the entire data set, that would be obtained by simply labeling all samples
as good. Over the entire data set, we require to classify more than 58.3\% of the data correctly.
The test set contains eight incorrect samples. We would therefore expect any naive classifier
to produce a 60\% accuracy, which we have to beat. In Table~\ref{tab:class_comp},
we observe that this is indeed the case for all three approaches evaluated here.
The random forest performed best in this case.
