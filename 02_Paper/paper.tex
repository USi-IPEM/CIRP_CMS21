%% The '3p' and 'times' class options of elsarticle are used for Elsevier CRC
%% The 'procedia' option causes ecrc to approximate to the Word template
\documentclass[5p,times,procedia]{elsarticle}
\flushbottom

%% The `ecrc' package must be called to make the CRC functionality available
\usepackage{ecrc}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Procedia CIRP}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{Author name}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.
\jid{trpro}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
%\jnltitlelogo{Transportation Research}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.
%% For more details see the existing template files elsarticle-template-harv.tex and elsarticle-template-num.tex.

%% Elsevier CRC generally uses a numbered reference style
%% For this, the conventions of elsarticle-template-num.tex should be followed (included below)
%% If using BibTeX, use the style file elsarticle-num.bst

%% End of ecrc-specific commands
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% The amssymb package provides various useful mathematical symbols

\usepackage{amssymb}
%% The amsthm package provides extended theorem environments
%% \usepackage{amsthm}

%% The lineno packages adds line numbers. Start line numbering with
%% \begin{linenumbers}, end it with \end{linenumbers}. Or switch it on
%% for the whole article with \linenumbers after \end{frontmatter}.
%% \usepackage{lineno}

%% natbib.sty is loaded by default. However, natbib options can be
%% provided with \biboptions{...} command. Following options are
%% valid:

%%   round  -  round parentheses are used (default)
%%   square -  square brackets are used   [option]
%%   curly  -  curly braces are used      {option}
%%   angle  -  angle brackets are used    <option>
%%   semicolon  -  multiple citations separated by semi-colon
%%   colon  - same as semicolon, an earlier confusion
%%   comma  -  separated by comma
%%   numbers-  selects numerical citations
%%   super  -  numerical citations as superscripts
%%   sort   -  sorts multiple citations according to order in ref. list
%%   sort&compress   -  like sort, but also compresses numerical citations
%%   compress - compresses without sorting

\begin{abstract}
%% Text of abstract
Quality assurance (QA) is an important task in manufacturing to assess whether products 
meet their specifications. However, QA might be expensive, time-consuming, incomplete, or delayed.
This paper presents a solution for predictive analytics in QA based on machine sensor values during
production while employing machine-learning models based on logistic regression in a controlled environment. 
Furthermore, we present lessons learned while implementing this model, which helps to reduce complexity in
further industrial applications. The paper’s outcome proves that the developed model was able to predict
product quality, as well as to identify the correlation between machine-status and faulty product occurrence.

\section{Introduction}

% a)	Products’ quality must always be guaranteed.
% b)	In certain cases (especially in series assembly production) there is a delay between quality inspection and end of the production process  high potential for producing scrap 
% c)	By doing quality inspection based on samples, there is still a risk of sending NOK parts to customers
% d)	Cost of quality check might be expensive
% e)	Quality assurance is normally done at the end of production (for assembly processes)   
% f)	Early prediction of the production’s quality  would help to decrease the amount of scrap  and the risk of sending NOK parts to customers
% g)	Variable predictions by using machine learning models is currently widely used in diverse fields due to its accurate predictions  with the data collected from the machines, prediction models can be implemented for specific predicted values
